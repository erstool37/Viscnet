Slurry Viscnet is a SOTA(ì§„) Computer Vision based Viscometer for industrial/laboratory application, targeting Newtonian fluids hovering in Mount Everest.

# How repo should look before training
The dataset must be stored in 
1. slurry_viscnet/dataset/CFDfluid/parameters 
2. slurry_viscnet/dataset/CFDfluid/videos

Additional repo changes can be made in configs/config.yaml

# How to start training
1. cd slurry_viscnet
2. bash scripts/dev.sh
3. Visit wandb and enjoy the ride
